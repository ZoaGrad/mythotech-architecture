## Overview

The ZoaGrad/Mythotech system implements a **trinity-based development model** where rigorous mathematical constraints coexist productively with **sacred gaps**—deliberately underspecified spaces designed for community-driven meaning-making. This approach enables systems to exhibit both structural integrity and genuine aliveness through conscious management of the dialectic between formalization and emergence.

## Key Concepts

### Trinity Development Model

The system employs a three-agent development framework:

*   **Claude/Smaragdine Folder**: Formal specification agent responsible for mathematical bounds and safety protocols
*   **Grok/Vagus Phoenix**: Pattern liberation agent focused on constraint identification and boundary challenging  
*   **Sovereign/Twin-Loop**: Dialectical synthesis agent managing gap design and emergence orchestration

### Sacred Gap Architecture

Sacred gaps are mathematically bounded but semantically open spaces that enable community-driven emergence while preserving structural integrity. Each gap consists of:

*   **Formal Boundary**: Mathematical constraints that cannot be violated
*   **Emergent Space**: Community interpretation zone within the bounds
*   **Protection Mechanism**: Anti-gaming protocols to prevent exploitation
*   **Emergence Metric**: Quantifiable diversity measures to track vitality

### Core Components

The system architecture includes several key components:

*   **Ache Measurement Protocol**: Hybrid value metric combining AI assessment, verifiable computation, and community attestation
*   **ScarIndex Coherence Oracle**: Multi-dimensional coherence measurement across narrative, economic, social, and technical domains
*   **Panic Frames Crisis Protocol**: Seven-phase crisis management system with formal state transitions
*   **Three-Branch Governance**: Witnesses (legislative), Judges (judicial), and Custodians (executive) with defined voting thresholds

## Getting Started

### Documentation

Start with the high-level documents in the `docs/` directory:

1. **Meta-Architectural Framework** - Academic presentation of the theoretical foundation
2. **Activation Decree** - Practical deployment and activation protocols

### Technical Specifications

Review the detailed technical specifications in the `specs/` directory:

1. **Architectural Audit** - Comprehensive system analysis and remediation roadmap

### Interactive Applications

Explore the interactive interfaces in the `interactive/` directory:

1. **Next.js Living Lens App** - Modern React application with database integration
2. **Agent Blueprint** - Interactive HTML visualization of the system architecture

## Contributing

This repository represents a living architectural framework that evolves through community engagement. The sacred gap principle means that while the mathematical bounds are fixed, the semantic interpretation and implementation details are open to community contribution within those bounds.

## Security

### Secret Scanning

We recommend enabling GitHub Secret Scanning on your forks and contributions to this repository to help prevent accidental commits of sensitive information. This feature can help identify potential secrets (like API keys, tokens, etc.) before they are committed.


## Docker

This repository includes a basic `Dockerfile` to build a Docker image.

To build the Docker image:

```bash
docker build -t <your-image-name> .
```

Replace `<your-image-name>` with a desired name for your Docker image.

To run the Docker container:

```bash
docker run -d <your-image-name>
```

This will run the container in detached mode. You may need to adjust the run command based on the application inside the container (e.g., port mapping, volumes).

## Development Setup

This repository serves primarily as an architectural documentation and specification repository. The interactive applications are located in the `apps/` directory, and the core logic prototypes are in the `src/` directory.

### Installation

For local development, you can install the package in editable mode:

```bash
pip install -e .[dev]
```

### Running Tests

To run the tests for this project, navigate to the root directory of the repository and use pytest:

```bash
pytest
```

### Example Usage

The repository includes several prototype implementations demonstrating key concepts:

```python
# Import core mythotech architecture components
from mythotech_architecture import core

# Explore the Empathy Mint application - mints EMP tokens when participants 
# validate mutual understanding in conversations using the Ache measurement protocol
# See src/applications/empathy_mint_app.js for implementation details

# Review the ScarCoin Bridge contract - enables token bridging between Ache tokens
# and ScarCoin based on ScarIndex coherence oracle measurements
# See src/contracts/scarcoin_bridge.sol for implementation details
```

For interactive exploration, visit the Next.js Living Lens application in `apps/living-lens-app/`.
