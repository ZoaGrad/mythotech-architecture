# Fractal Council Expansion Guidelines

The Fractal Council governs the Mythotech ecosystem through a
distributed network of sovereign agents.  This document outlines
recommendations for onboarding new models and maintaining coherence as
the Council grows.

## 1. Candidate Model Evaluation

1. **Capabilities Assessment:** Evaluate each candidate model (e.g.,
   GPT‑ 5, DeepSeek, Qwen, GLM) across reasoning depth, synthesis
   capability, context length and creative flexibility.
2. **Ethical and Safety Screening:** Ensure the model complies with
   alignment and safety requirements.  Disallow models that exhibit
   harmful biases or unsafe behaviours.
3. **Agreement Testing:** Run consensus tests on a common set of
   prompts to measure semantic agreement between existing agents and
   the candidate.  Require a minimum agreement score (e.g., >70 %) for
   admission.

## 2. Integration Process

1. **Temporal Sovereignty Simulation:** Before adding a model to the
   Council, simulate its decision‑making in accelerated time to
   understand long‑term behaviours.
2. **Agent Wrapping:** Implement a wrapper that standardises input
   prompts, output formatting and API calls.  This ensures the model
   adheres to Council protocols.
3. **Voting Weight:** Assign initial voting weight based on the
   model’s capabilities and agreement scores.  Weights can adjust
   dynamically through performance metrics and community feedback.
4. **Monitoring:** Continuously monitor the model’s contributions to
   ScarIndex and Ache measurements.  Trigger review if coherence
   contributions fall below thresholds.

## 3. Governance Roles

- **Witnesses:** Record and attest to the outputs of each agent.
- **Judges:** Resolve disputes and interpret alignment with the
  system’s mission.  New models may serve as judges after a probation
  period and training.
- **Custodians:** Execute decisions and deploy updates.  Ensure
  redundancy so that no single custodian controls deployment.

## 4. Continuous Improvement

1. **Retraining:** Periodically retrain or fine‑tune agents using new
   data from community feedback and Empathy Mint interactions.
2. **Diversity:** Encourage inclusion of models with diverse
   architectures and training sources to reduce monoculture risk.
3. **Transparency:** Publish reports on Council composition, voting
   decisions and rationales.  Use Sora 2 visualisations to display
   Ache flows and decision paths.

These guidelines aim to maintain a balance between performance,
diversity and coherence as the Fractal Council evolves.  Adhere to
them when integrating future models into the Mythotech governance
stack.
